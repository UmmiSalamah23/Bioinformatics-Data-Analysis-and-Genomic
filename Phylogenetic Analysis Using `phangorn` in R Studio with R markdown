# Phylogenetic Analysis Using `phangorn` in R

This repository contains an example of phylogenetic analysis using the R package `phangorn`. The analysis covers both distance-based and character-based methods (NJ, UPGMA, Parsimony), including bootstrap evaluation and tree comparison.

---

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following R packages installed:

````r
install.packages("ape")
install.packages("phangorn")
install.packages("igraph") # optional, used in some visualizations


## Step 1: Load Data

We begin by loading the required packages and reading the DNA alignment data (`primates.dna`) included in the `phangorn` package.

library(ape)
library(phangorn)

fdir <- system.file("extdata/trees", package = "phangorn")
primates <- read.phyDat(file.path(fdir, "primates.dna"), format = "interleaved")

## Step 2: Reconstruct Trees (Distance-Based)
Create a distance matrix using dist.ml(), then build trees using UPGMA and Neighbor Joining (NJ) methods.
```r
dm <- dist.ml(primates)
treeUPGMA <- upgma(dm)
treeNJ <- NJ(dm)
````

## Step 3: Visualize Trees

```r
plot(treeUPGMA, main="UPGMA Tree")       # Rooted
plot(treeNJ, main="Neighbor Joining Tree")  # Unrooted
```

## Step 4: Bootstrap Analysis

```r
Bootstrap for UPGMA Tree:
fun <- function(x) upgma(dist.ml(x))
bs_upgma <- bootstrap.phyDat(primates, fun)
plotBS(treeUPGMA, bs_upgma, main="UPGMA with Bootstrap")
Bootstrap for NJ Tree:
fun2 <- function(x) nj(dist.ml(x))
bs_nj <- bootstrap.phyDat(primates, fun2)
plotBS(treeNJ, bs_nj, main="NJ with Bootstrap")
```

## Part B: Character-Based Method (Parsimony)

Calculate parsimony scores:
parsimony(treeUPGMA, primates)  # \[1] 751
parsimony(treeNJ, primates)     # \[1] 746

Construct Parsimony Tree with pratchet:

```r
treeRatchet <- pratchet(primates, trace = 0, minit = 100)
parsimony(treeRatchet, primates)  # [1] 746
Finalize the tree (optimize branch lengths and remove zero-length edges):
treeRatchet <- acctran(treeRatchet, primates)
treeRatchet <- di2multi(treeRatchet)

if(inherits(treeRatchet, "multiPhylo")){
  treeRatchet <- unique(treeRatchet)
}
```

## Visualize Parsimony Tree with Bootstrap Support:

```r
plotBS(midpoint(treeRatchet), type="phylogram")
add.scale.bar()
```

## Interpretation

The phylogenetic trees reconstructed using UPGMA, NJ, and Parsimony show similar overall topologies, with some variation in branching order and outgroup placement.

* **UPGMA** assumes a molecular clock and thus builds a **rooted** tree. It selected *Mouse* as an outgroup, possibly due to consistent evolutionary distances across taxa. However, this assumption may not hold in real biological data.

* **NJ**, a more flexible distance-based method, produced an **unrooted** tree with *Bovine* as an outgroup. This indicates it detected more sequence similarity between the primates and other taxa than UPGMA.

* **Bootstrap analysis** shows higher support in the NJ tree, suggesting it is more stable across replicates and thus more reliable.

* **Parsimony analysis** yielded a tree with the lowest number of evolutionary changes (score = 746), suggesting it may better reflect the minimum number of mutations needed to explain the observed data. The tree optimization (acctran) helped resolve ambiguous branches.

Overall, NJ with bootstrap support appears to be the most informative and consistent approach for this dataset.
