# Phylogenetic Analysis with MEGA

## Description
This project used MEGA X to construct a phylogenetic tree based on bacterial 16S rRNA sequences. Alignment was performed using ClustalW, and the tree was built using the Neighbor-Joining method with 1000 bootstrap replications.

## Tools
- MEGA X
- ClustalW (built-in)
- Bootstrap Analysis

## Output
### Maximum Likelihood Tree

## Steps
1. **Import sequences into MEGA**: Import bacterial 16S rRNA sequences into MEGA X.
2. **Align using ClustalW**: Perform multiple sequence alignment using ClustalW.
3. **Build NJ, ML, MP, UPGMA tree with bootstrap**: Construct the phylogenetic tree using the Neighbor-Joining method with 1000 bootstrap replications.
4. **Export and upload the tree**: Export the resulting tree and upload it to the GitHub repository.
